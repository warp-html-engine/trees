// Package trees is a work inspired by a experiemental package by now authors
// of Vecty(github.com/gopherjs/vecty), although the provide similar API, the
// underline nature of how gutrees behave and function is heavily different
// from its original. It provides a markup style that is seperate from the
// browser DOM yet capable of being generated into one and spots a quick
// virtual diffing system that makes it easy to upgrade existing markup with
// less cycles.
